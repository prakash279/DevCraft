# DevCraft

### Devcraft is a project created to help developers get ease in creating projects, by breaking it down into smaller steps and then working on each step.

#### The first feature of DevCraft is to easily get codes from documentation without reading or understanding the whole thing. I often face this issue in hackathons with very less time and quite a small expeirence of using libraries it feels difficult to search for code snippets for what exact task we want to perform so this feature will help you with getting code snippets from the documentation, by just giving it the link.
